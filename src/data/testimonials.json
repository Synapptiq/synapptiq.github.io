We deployed our first clinical decision support model in Epic within three weeks, and our research teams now iterate on AI applications without waiting for IT resources. The OMOP standardization alone saved us hundreds of development hours.",

Synapptiq's FedRAMP authorization and comprehensive audit logging gave our CISO confidence to approve the platform. The native Cerner integration meant zero custom API development, and we maintained full control over data governance while empowering our clinical researchers.",

Our data scientists can now deploy models trained on OMOP data directly into clinical workflows. The platform reduced our AI deployment time from quarters to weeks, and the ROI is undeniable.",

We integrated 18 months of ICU data from Epic, deployed three competing AI models, and had results in production within 45 days. The platform's standardization layer meant we could compare models trained at different institutions without rebuilding our data pipeline. This is the secure AI deployment infrastructure healthcare has needed.",
